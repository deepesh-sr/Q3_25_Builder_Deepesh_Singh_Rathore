## 🚀 What is TrustPlay V2?

TrustPlay V2 is a revolutionary decentralized tournament platform that eliminates the need for trust between organizers and participants. Built on Solana's high-performance blockchain, it ensures transparent, automatic, and secure prize distribution for gaming tournaments.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🏆 **Trustless Prize Distribution** - Smart contracts automatically distribute winnings
- 🔒 **Secure Escrow System** - Prize pools are locked in program-controlled vaults
- ⚡ **Lightning Fast** - Built on Solana for instant transactions
- 💰 **Low Fees** - Minimal transaction costs for maximum prize retention
- 🎯 **Fair Play** - Transparent and verifiable tournament mechanics
- 🔧 **Organizer Tools** - Easy tournament setup and management

## 🎯 How It Works

    C --> D[Tournament Happens Off-Chain]
    D --> E[Organizer Declares Winners]
    E --> F[Smart Contract Distributes Prizes]
    F --> G[Winners Receive SOL Automatically]
```

### 🏗️ Architecture

1. **Room Creation** - Organizers initialize tournament rooms with metadata
2. **Vault System** - Prize pools are securely held in program-derived accounts
3. **Player Management** - Secure join/leave mechanics with validation
4. **Prize Distribution** - Automated, fair distribution to 1-3 winners

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Blockchain**: Solana
- **Framework**: Anchor 0.31.1
- **Language**: Rust (Smart Contracts), TypeScript (Tests)
- **Testing**: Mocha/Chai with Anchor integration

## 📋 Program Instructions

| Instruction | Description | Authority |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| `initialize` | Create a new tournament room | Organizer |
| `join_room` | Join an existing tournament | Players |
| `deposit_to_vault` | Add prize money to tournament | Organizer |
| `distribute_prizes` | Award winnings to participants | Organizer |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Solana CLI
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.18.4/install)"

# Install Anchor
npm install -g @coral-xyz/anchor-cli

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 🔧 Setup & Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trustplay-v2.git
cd trustplay-v2

# Build the program
anchor build

# Run tests
anchor test

# Deploy to localnet
anchor deploy
```

### 📊 Testing

Our comprehensive test suite covers all core functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
anchor test

# Test individual components
anchor test --grep "Initializes the Room"
anchor test --grep "Let Players Join Room"
anchor test --grep "Deposit Money to Vault"
anchor test --grep "Distribute Prizes"
```

## 🎮 Usage Example

### Creating a Tournament

```typescript
// Initialize a new tournament
const tx = await program.methods
  .initialize("SolPlay Championship")
  .accountsStrict({
    organizer: organizer.publicKey,
    room: roomPDA,
    vaultState: vaultStatePDA,
    vault: vaultPDA,
    systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId
  })
  .rpc();

// Deposit prize pool
await program.methods
  .depositToVault(new BN(5 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL)) // 5 SOL prize
  .accounts({ organizer: organizer.publicKey })
  .rpc();
```

### Joining a Tournament

```typescript
// Player joins the tournament
await program.methods
  .joinRoom()
  .accountsStrict({
    player: player.publicKey,
    room: roomPDA,
    systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId
  })
  .signers([player])
  .rpc();
```

### Distributing Prizes

```typescript
// Distribute to single winner (gets full prize)
await program.methods
  .distributePrizes()
  .accountsStrict({
    organizer: organizer.publicKey,
    room: roomPDA,
    vaultState: vaultStatePDA,
    vault: vaultPDA,
    winnerAccount: winner.publicKey,
    systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId
  })
  .rpc();
```

## 🏆 Prize Distribution Logic

- **Single Winner**: Receives 100% of prize pool
- **Two Winners**: Each receives 50% of prize pool
- **Three Winners**: Each receives 33.33% of prize pool
- **Rounding**: Any remaining lamports go to the last winner

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ **PDA-based Access Control** - Only authorized parties can perform actions
- ✅ **Seed-based Account Derivation** - Predictable and secure account generation
- ✅ **Constraint Validation** - Comprehensive input validation and error handling
- ✅ **Rent-exempt Reserves** - Accounts maintain minimum balance requirements
- ✅ **Signer Verification** - All transactions require appropriate signatures
